# DALL-E API Setup for Image Generation

## ðŸŽ¨ **Why DALL-E?**

Your Firebase deployment likely uses DALL-E or a similar image generation service. To get the same quality image generation locally, you need to add DALL-E API support.

## ðŸ“‹ **Setup Steps**

### 1. Get OpenAI API Key
1. Go to [OpenAI Platform](https://platform.openai.com/)
2. Sign up or log in
3. Go to "API Keys" section
4. Create a new API key
5. Copy the key (starts with `sk-`)

### 2. Add to Environment Variables
Add this line to your `.env` file:

```env
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-your-api-key-here
```

### 3. Restart the Server
```bash
npm run dev
```

## ðŸš€ **How It Works**

1. **User clicks "Illustrate this?"** â†’ ParagraphActions component
2. **ParagraphActions calls generateImageForStory** â†’ AI Flow
3. **AI Flow sends prompt to DALL-E API** â†’ Creates high-quality image
4. **Image returned as Data URI** â†’ Displayed in your story

## ðŸ’° **Cost**

- DALL-E 3: ~$0.04 per image
- Very affordable for personal use
- Same quality as your Firebase deployment

## ðŸ”§ **Alternative: Check Your Firebase**

If you want to see what image generation service your Firebase deployment uses:

1. Check your Firebase environment variables
2. Look for image generation API keys
3. Copy the same configuration to local development

## âœ… **Current Status**

- âœ… Story Creation: Working
- âœ… Chat with AI: Working  
- âœ… Local Storage: Working
- âœ… Image Generation: Ready for DALL-E API key

**Just add your OpenAI API key to `.env` and restart the server!**
